    "We analyse the spontaneous emission (SE) rate of the EDTS layer in air and covered with water, denoted $1$ and $2$, respectively. Observing that that the SE rates calculated from PL measurements, $\\Gamma^{1, 2} \\equiv 1/\\tau^{1,2}$, are composed of radiative, $\\Gamma_{rad}$, and non-radiative, $\\Gamma_{nrad}$, components gives\n",
